# Computer Vision on the Control of Robotic Manipulator
Computer Vision on the Control of Robotic Manipulator - Board game application - Final Project and Paper for Industrial Automation degree by Willian Esperandio

Paper (in Brazilian Portuguese): (yet to be published)

Main goal:
  - Create a computer vision based system that guides an arduino-based robotic arm to play Tic-Tac-Toe

Developed Systems:
  - Computer Vision based on Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, Python 3 and OpenCV 3.4
  - Robotic Manipulator based on CrustCrawler SG6-UT Robotic Arm and Arduino Uno Rev3
  - Serial communication between Raspberry Pi and Arduino

Contains:
  - All developed codes for the computer vision system, serial communication and robotic arm control
